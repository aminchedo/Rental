# üîí Production Security Update Report

## Critical Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ Issue #1: Database Query Bug (FIXED)
**Location**: `server/database.js:242`
**Problem**: Income chart query referenced non-existent `monthlyRent` field
**Solution**: Changed to correct `rentAmount` field name
**Status**: RESOLVED ‚úÖ

```sql
-- Before (broken):
SUM(CAST(monthlyRent as INTEGER)) as income,

-- After (fixed):
SUM(CAST(rentAmount as INTEGER)) as income,
```

**Verification**: API endpoint `/api/charts/income` now returns proper data:
```json
[{"month":"ÿ¢ÿ®ÿßŸÜ 2025","income":5000000,"contracts":1}]
```

### ‚úÖ Issue #2: Production Environment Security (FIXED)
**Problems Addressed**:
1. Missing .env configuration
2. Insecure session secret
3. Hard-coded CORS origins
4. Production cookie security

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Created secure `.env` file with generated session secret
2. Updated CORS to use environment variables
3. Configured secure cookies for production
4. Added proper environment variable structure

**Files Modified**:
- `server/.env` (created with secure configuration)
- `server/server.js` (updated CORS and cookie security)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue #3: Default Admin Credentials (SECURITY WARNING)
**Current Status**: Default admin/admin credentials still active
**Recommendation**: Change immediately in production
**Location**: Database user table and setup.js

### üìã Issue #4: Missing Notification Services (DOCUMENTATION CLARIFIED)
**Current Implementation**: 
- ‚úÖ Email notifications (SMTP) - Fully functional
- ‚ùå Telegram notifications - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- ‚ùå WhatsApp notifications - NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Reality**: Only email notifications are implemented. Documentation should be updated to reflect actual capabilities.
